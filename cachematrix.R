## As indicated in the assignment, the goal of the functions is caching the inverse of a matrix

## As requested in the assignment, this function seeks to create a  creates a matrix object that can cache its inverse.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## As requested in the assignment, this function seeks to calculate and obtain the inverse of the matrix that we previously had

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
